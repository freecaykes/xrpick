# xrpick 

Slopped a tool for `xrandr` so I don't have to remember the whole man page. Intented for a laptop with and `i3` GUI using `xrandr` often.  

## Build

`cargo build --release`

The generated binary will in `.../target/release/xrpick`.  Move it to a designated `/bin/` folder for direct `xrpick` command.
